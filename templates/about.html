  <h5 class="card-title">How We Met</h5>
  <p class="card-text">How did our love story begin?
    April 12, 2019 John and Sarah were on a dating website. They began talking, and while neither were anticipating a relationship, John asked Sarah if she would attend a Christian concert with him.  Sarah accepted the offer, as she was excited for a night out. As what seemed as just a casual meet up at a concert, turned into a date of laughs, drinks, food and a walk on the beach. And so, the journey began and John and Sarah became inseparable. 
    John and Sarah went on many adventures together, always having a good time. At the beginning of their dating story, John bought a dinghy to relax and enjoy on the water. John and Sarah spent many evenings and days fishing and being on the water.</p>

  <h5 class="card-title">Popping The Question</h5>
  <p class="card-text">As John and Sarah continued on their journey, they realized that they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together. John had planned to ask Sarah to marry him. So what did John do? He flew to Alberta to surprise Sarahâ€™s parents by asking for her hand in marriage. They gave John their blessing, and he came back to BC to prepare for his proposal. He went out and got the most beautiful ring he could find. Then he planned how to ask the big question. Exactly one year later from the day John and Sarah had their first date they planned on celebrating their first anniversary on Easter Sunday, April 12, 2020. After Church on Sunday, John asked Sarah if she would wear a nice dress to celebrate their one year anniversary. Sarah agreed and she wore her white summer dress, as they were going to adventure out on a picnic together. John picked up Sarah from her house, and they started taking a nice drive out towards Whistler. Trying to find the perfect spot, with mountains and water, they were having difficulty as most parks were closed due to Covid. So, they kept on driving up past Pemberton when John made the perfect turn and found the most beautiful secluded lake. It was a warm sunny day sitting by the water, with beautiful mountains in the background. John surprised Sarah with a cute little picnic basket filled with plates, wine glasses, meats, cheeses, crackers, caviar and a bottle of wine, with the most perfect box of chocolates. So John and Sarah ate and talked, enjoying each others company. After a while of already having the most perfect evening, as they were standing up, John got down on one knee and asked Sarah to marry him. She immediately said yes, and gave him the biggest hug. Followed by, asking him if he even asked her parents. John knew that was a very important step and revealed that he indeed flew all the way to Alberta to ask her parents if he could marry her. Sarah was shocked and surprised as she had no idea that ever happened.  Her eyes lit up, as she was so happy that she would get to spend the rest of her life with her love.</p>

  <h5 class="card-title">Love Grows</h5>
  <p class="card-text">Exploring new places and scouting out the best waterfalls was one of their favorite things to do together. They also enjoyed meals at new restaurants, and attending different festivals and activities. Sarah loved how John made her laugh all the time. Most of all, they bonded on their shared belief and foundation in God. They made a commitment to attend church on Sundays and weekly bible studies together.</p>

  <li class="list-group-item">On one evening, John asked Sarah, along with a couple friends if they would attend a fundraiser called EPIC. John had raved about this event as being one of his favourite nights. So on August 31,, 2019 John took Sarah and friends to enjoy a night of socializing and eating a really good meal to fundraise for a local charity. That night, while John and Sarah were sitting at a table, John looked at Sarah and told her he loved her. This turned out to be one of the best and most memorable nights.</li>
